# Stock_Price_Prediction
This project focused on predicting stock prices in the energy sector, analyzing Exxon Mobile (XOM) and NextEra Energy (NEE) to contrast fossil fuel and renewable energy companies. Employing ARIMA and LSTM models over the period from Jan 2019 to Nov 2023, the study aimed to assess COVID-19's impact and model performance during economic downturns. ARIMA parameters were chosen using AIC and BIC, with differential analysis guiding 'd' values. LSTM utilized 60-day price data and demonstrated stable training loss. Despite LSTM's promise, ARIMA outperformed, evident in lower mean squared errors and superior prediction accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in forecasting energy sector stock prices.
